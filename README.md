# BardAPI-PHP
The PHP package that returns response of Google Bard through cookie value in pretty view.

I was inspired to develop after publishing a pull request at https://github.com/pj8912/php-bard-api. The main part of the code is taken from here, but further development will not depend on it.

I welcome comments or bug reports you have.
